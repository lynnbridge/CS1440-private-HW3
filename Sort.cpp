/*
 * An example comparator used when sorting Area objects.
 *
 * Use this code as a guide when writing your own comparators for Employment
 * objects.
 *
 * This comparator compares two Area objects on the basis of their FIPS code.
 * If the left-hand argument is "less than" the right-hand argument, it returns
 * -1. If the one on the left is greater, it returns 1. When they are equal 0
 *  is returned. qsort() uses this information to decide whether to swap these
 *  two objects.
 *
 * Notice that the type given for the left and right objects is `void *`. We
 * know that these objects are actually of type `Area *`. But this comparator
 * is called by qsort(), which we didn't write, and therefore it doesn't know
 * about the classes we have created in our code. Because qsort() has no way
 * of knowing about our Area object it can only treat our Area objects as a
 * bunch of bits & bytes.
 *
 * Since we are writing the comparator, we can use our knowledge of the Area
 * type to access the fields within. The static_cast operator converts the
 * bunch of bits & bytes back into `Area *` which allows us to access the
 * area_fips field.
